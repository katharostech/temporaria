## Story

A long time ago there were a group of hostile kingdoms that hated each-other intensely. When they were all threatened by fierce opponents from a faraway land, they begrudgingly established a temporary alliance and kingdom that they called Temporaria, united against their common enemy. Because of their lack of trust, instead of one king, they had three equally powered leaders, one from each group, that led the Kingdom.

This united kingdom successfully vanquished it's foes, and their alliance, unlike most alliances, lasted longer than they intended. Hundreds of years later they were still a united and thriving kingdom, though their groups still had their differences, they had learned to help each-other and live together.

Now, when evil yet again faces Kingdom, they must summon and train new knights to fight for their freedom. Only you can help save the kingdom from destruction. **Temporaria forever!**
